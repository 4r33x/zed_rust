# My rust zed setup with custom theme

Problems comparing to vscode:

1. No sematic tokens (should be resolved soon): https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/39539
2. Zed currently only colors the icon depending on diagnostics, not the file name text (maybe fork? https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/18182)
3. Font ligatures broken at least on Arch Linux (https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/issues/12176)
4. No rainbow tokens (should be resolved soon): https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/pull/43172
5. Self {...} is not special
6. Need more portals in Hyprland - no way to add default picker app (eg Firefox as default browser or nautilus as file manager)
